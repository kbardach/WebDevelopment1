            <div>
                <h3>What products do you use?</h3>
                <p>We primarily use products recommended by the Asthma & Allergy Association and those that meet the criteria for the Nordic Swan Ecolabel. We manage all leftover materials and construction waste, sorting and delivering them to authorized recycling facilities to minimize environmental impact.</p>
            </div>
    
            <div>
                <h3>How do we proceed to get a quote for what we need help with?</h3>
                <p>Start by filling out our quote form. We are happy to visit and review the work on-site to see what treatments need to be done. After that, we will send a free and detailed quote.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>Are there any additional costs beyond the price in the quote?</h3>
                <p>In most cases, we set a fixed price for the work (unless the customer wants us to work by the hour). The price in the quote is the final cost. Additional costs may occur for changes or additional work beyond what was agreed upon in the quote. This is something we document with photos and seek approval from the customer before proceeding. We are happy to provide records of our working hours and delivery notes for the materials used.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>What are your working hours?</h3>
                <p>Our working hours are from 7:00 AM to 4:00 PM, unless otherwise agreed.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h3>How long does the work take?</h3>
                <p class="bottom">It naturally depends on the size of the project, but our quotes always include an estimated time for the work. Our motto is to always deliver top quality on time.</p>
